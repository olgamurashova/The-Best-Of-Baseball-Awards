## The Best Of Baseball Awards

### Project description

In this project I have been working with a massive baseball dataset that was put together by Sean Lahman and was made ported to a PostgreSQL database by Codecademy platform. This dataset contains data from 2019 all the way back to 1871. This work is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported License.
Detailed documentation about the dataset is available [here](https://www.seanlahman.com/files/database/readme2017.txt).

There are 29 tables in the dataset. First, I created a database using ```PostgreSQL```. Then, you imported the dataset content as the .sql file in ```Postbird```.  Once, the dataset tables were uploaded, I manipulated and connected multiple tables using sql queries. The sql statement queries used to analyze the data as well as outputs are enclosed in this repository.
